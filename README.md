# B.S. and M.S. in Engineering
For more information on my undergraduate work, visit [Undegrad Blog](https://blogs.gwu.edu/lsamoyan/)

My name is Lily Samoyan, and I'd like to consider myself a generalist when it comes to engineering. This is not only due to my experience, but where I believe I thrive. Within the engineering deisgn cycle, I believe my strengths are my ability to conceive and prototype a project, innovate and verify projects, while also being able to manage timelines and schedules. I have a passion for innovation and impact, and want my career to be one in which I can make an impact with my work in one way or another. I'm always working on a project of my own as a creative outlet to see what I can do. My penchant for picking up skills and learning new technical talents is reflected in my projects, certifications, and pursuit of further education.

### Professional Projects
 - **[LiFi Secured Subnet](/_pages/lifi_serve.md)**: Installed and configured a LiFi network to demonstrate the capability of LiFi in creating private enclave networks within a space, and even network speeds and fidelity.
    - **Skills**: DHCP Client Setup, DNS, Flask, Routing, WSGI, Docker
- **[ML Enabled Sonobuoy](/_pages/sonobuoy.md)**: Continued with the design, assembly, and testing of an ML enabled sonar buoy. This demonstrated the capability of the Iridium network, and start-up technology for low power data transmission over extended periods of time in areas where there lacks information coverage.
    - **Skills**: Microelectronics, Data Analytics, Engineering Design
 - **[TAK Server Setup](/_pages/tak_serve.md)**: Worked with Docker and an RPI to setup an TAK management platform for all devices within our office. Utilized ZeroTier to setup a subnet for those TAK devices to communicate via corporate prototyping network.
    - **Skills**: Docker, Networking (ZeroTier)
 - **[FPV Drones](/_pages/fpv_drone.md)**: I was part of an effort to understand how long it takes to construct and the quality of Ukranian FPV Drones. In this effort, this involved translation of the Ukranian written resources and videos, sourcing the parts, and construction of the drone.
    - **Skills**: Microelectronics, Firmware, Assembly, 3D Printing, CAD (Solidworks 2023), Mission Planning (Mission Planner, QGroundControl, ArduPilot, Auterion Suite)
 - **[Test Drones](/_pages/test_drone.md)**: As a prototyper, I worked on the construction of a few regular drones for battery testing purposes of other members of our team. 
    - **Skills**: Microelectronics, Firmware, Assembly, 3D Printing, CAD (Solidworks 2023), Mission Planning (Mission Planner, QGroundControl, ArduPilot, Auterion Suite)

### University
 - **[SAE GWU BAJA](https://blogs.gwu.edu/lsamoyan/gwu-baja-off-roading-vehicle-adventures/)**: Designed and manufactured a steering rack, column, and wheel provide a working steering system in competition.
    - **Skills**: CAD, Program Management, Manufacturing, Mechanical Analysis
- **[Senior Capstone](https://blogs.gwu.edu/lsamoyan/senior-capstone-steering-system/)**: Led the design of a off-roading steering system designed for impact. Was team leader and did the total design of the gearbox.
    - **Skills**: CAD, Program Management, Manufacturing, Mechanical Analysis

### Personal
 - **[Dave Brain](https://blogs.gwu.edu/lsamoyan/personal-projects/)**: Bought a broken toy cart, added an RPI, camera, microphone, speaker, and wheel motors to SSH into the Pi over the GW enterprise network to drive around campus as a way to communicate with groups of students.
    - **Skills**: Prototyping, Microelectronics, Python
 - **[Revolutionizing Campus Transportation](https://blogs.gwu.edu/lsamoyan/personal-projects/)**: Salvaged a driveable toy car, ripped out all of the wiring and rewired the vehicle and it's bluetooth system as a way to commute through campus.
    - **Skills**: Prototyping, Microelectronics
